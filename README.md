# Network Automation 101 Workshop

# Why Automate?

* Digital transformation â€“ Moving workloads between Private and Public Clouds
* Organizations are modernizing their business strategies and technologies to better support customer needs
* As companies embrace digital transformation, they need to move at the pace of software, new apps, new clouds and new technologies
* Traditional networking engineering and administration often do not align with those requirements

#### By adopting network automation organizations can take advantage of the following:

### Standardized Processes

* Reduced chance of human errors, which affect network performance and security
* Eliminate manual network tasks and enhance network functionality

### Robust Quality Control

*  Integrated testing
*  Ability to locate and identify the root cause of network or security issues before deploying to production
  
### Speed and Agility

*  Continuous Improvement
*  Rapid provisioning of new services, self service provisioning, enhancements, and upgrades

# What's The Fear?

### Culture change
*  Organization commitment
*  Top down, bottom up

### Willingness to learn new things
*  Takes 15 minutes for me to do it, it will take me hours to automate
  
## Machines should do repetitive work, people should do problem solving!

# The Network Automation Workshop

*  We have designed a network automation workshop to help network engineers become familiar with the technology
*  To overcome some of the fears

#### We have broken it down into the following stages:
